# Count Words

A brief description of your project.

## Business Rules

The program applies the following business rules to the input list of strings:

- Counts and returns the **NUMBER** of words (i.e. Strings) that start with "M" or "m"
- Return **all the words longer than 5 characters**

## Usage

To use the Count Words program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone** the repository:
   
git clone  https://github.com/winatamika/CountWordsJavaCsg.git


2. **Open** the project in your Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. **Open** the `CountWords.java` file located in the `src` folder.

4. **Modify** the input words:

- Open the `CountWords.java` file.
- Locate the `wordSeries` variable.
- Update the `wordSeries` variable with your desired list of words. Make sure each word is separated by a space.

5. **Build and run** the program:

- Build the project using your IDE's build command.
- Run the program by executing the main method in the `CountWords.java` file.

6. **View** the results:

- The program will display the number of words starting with "M" or "m" and a list of words longer than 5 characters.

## Changing Business Rules

The Count Words program has been designed to accommodate changing business rules. To modify or add new rules, you can make the following updates:

- **Update** the logic in the `countWordsStartingWith` method in the `WordProcessor` class to change the conditions for counting words starting with a specific prefix.
- **Update** the logic in the `getLongWords` method in the `WordProcessor` class to modify the condition for selecting words longer than a specific length.

By updating these methods with new business rules, you can adapt the program to meet changing requirements.
